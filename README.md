# Music Player

## Description

Welcome to the Music Player project, a sophisticated application developed collaboratively by me and my college colleague, Mayana. This music player offers a comprehensive library of over 100 songs, providing users with the capability to play, pause, skip, and shuffle tracks within their playlists. Additionally, users can curate their own playlists to enhance their listening experience.

The Music Player is meticulously crafted using Python with the Tkinter GUI module, and it leverages MySQL for robust backend support, with data management facilitated through PHPMyAdmin. The application includes secure login and signup forms, ensuring a personalized and secure user experience. The backend architecture effectively manages user data, including playlist names and the songs contained within each playlist.

A standout feature of this application is its ability to transform YouTube music links into playable audio files. This functionality is powered by the YouTube API and the `youtube_dl` module, enabling seamless integration of YouTube content into the user's music library.
